# How to include in your own projects

## Wiki-Modules 
To limit the Size of this Repository, individual Sub-Repositories are singled out, which can be cloned and versioned independently. 

### xLarge Module
An important one is the 'xLarge' (eXtra large) Module, dedicated to store 'Attachments', i.e. large, binary Files.  When mounted directly in Obsidian, this Folder should be marked as the Destination for Attachments.
The name was chosen deliberately to place it at the end of the Folder List

### GIT SubModules 
SubModules proved to create friction and conflicts in a highly distributed System of Wiki-Repositories. 

SubModules offer the Benefit of including all required Modules optionally, 
but they fix the Module's Version/Hash and therefore need to be updated regularly to keep up with the linked Content. 

Especially with nested Sub-Modules, Conflicts in Hashes are very likely, hard to resolve, and factually irrelevant. 
Therefore the Modules should typically be cloned into an ignored Folder and versioned independently. 
Nonetheless, private Repositories may find it useful to include this Repository as a Sub-Module for ease of use.
