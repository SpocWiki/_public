# SpocWiki
This Repository contains community-maintained, shared, public, freely usable Text and Data to mix into your personal Knowledge Base.

Different from Wikipedia, you can...
- easily synchronize this with a local sub-folder on your local computer
  and keep personal and public information separate.
- simply update and expand the SpocWiki Data and push the changes back to the community for everyone to benefit 



# How to include in your own projects
This Repository can be cloned or referenced as a Submodule in other Wikis/Vaults.  
Pull-Requests are welcome, but read the Section about [#How to contribute](#How%20to%20contribute) first!
The [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) is chosen to be compatible with Wikipedia and Wikidata,
so that Information can freely be exchanged with this Repository.

## Wiki-Modules 
To limit the Size of this Repository, individual Sub-Repositories are singled out, which can be cloned and versioned independently. 

### xLarge Module
An important one is the 'xLarge' (eXtra large) Module, dedicated to store 'Attachments', i.e. large, binary Files.  When mounted directly in Obsidian, this Folder should be marked as the Destination for Attachments.
The name was chosen deliberately to place it at the end of the Folder List

### GIT SubModules 
SubModules proved to create friction and conflicts in a highly distributed System of Wiki-Repositories. 

SubModules offer the Benefit of including all required Modules optionally, 
but they fix the Module's Version/Hash and therefore need to be updated regularly to keep up with the linked Content. 

Especially with nested Sub-Modules, Conflicts in Hashes are very likely, hard to resolve, and factually irrelevant. 
Therefore the Modules should typically be cloned into an ignored Folder and versioned independently. 
Nonetheless, private Repositories may find it useful to include this Repository as a Sub-Module for ease of use.
