> The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. 
> It was formed 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, 
> forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. 
> 
> The Sun is an ordinary main sequence star that maintains a balanced equilibrium 
> by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. 
>
> The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. 
> In order from the [[Sun]], they are 
> - four terrestrial planets ([[Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[../../_Standards/Earth|Earth]] and [[Mars]]); 
> - two gas giants ([[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]); 
>  - and two ice giants ([[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]). 
> 
> All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. 
> Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. 
> Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.
>
> There is a strong consensus among astronomers that the Solar System has at least eight dwarf planets: 
> Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna. 
> There are a vast number of small Solar System bodies, such as 
> asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust clouds. 
> 
> Some of these bodies are in the asteroid belt (between Mars's and Jupiter's orbit) 
> and the Kuiper belt (just outside Neptune's orbit). 
> Six planets, six dwarf planets, and other bodies have orbiting natural satellites, which are commonly called 'moons'.
>
> The Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun's charged particles, the solar wind, forming the heliosphere. 
> Around 75–90 astronomical units from the Sun, the solar wind is halted, resulting in the heliopause. 
> This is the boundary of the Solar System to interstellar space. 
> 
> The outermost region of the Solar System is the theorized Oort cloud, the source for long-period comets, 
> extending to a radius of 2,000–200,000 astronomical units (0.032–3.2 light-years). 
> The closest star to the Solar System, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light-years (269,000 AU) away. 
> Both stars belong to the [[Milky_Way]] galaxy.
