> **Jupiter** is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. 
> A gas giant, Jupiter's mass is more than two and a half times that 
> of all the other planets in the Solar System combined 
> and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. 
> 
> Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. 
> It is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus 
> and has been observed since prehistoric times. 
> Its name derives from Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.
>
> Jupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System 
> impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. 
> 
> Hydrogen constitutes 90% of Jupiter's volume, 
> followed by helium, which forms 25% of its mass and 10% of its volume. 
> 
> The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat 
> than the planet receives from the Sun. 
> 
> Its internal structure is believed to consist of an outer mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen 
> and a diffuse inner core of denser material. 
> Because of its rapid rotation rate of one rotation per ten hours, 
> Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid; 
> it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. 
> The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, 
> with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. 
> The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, 
> a giant storm that has been recorded since at least 1831.
>
> Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, 
> the second largest contiguous structure in the Solar System (after the heliosphere). 
> Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the 
> four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: [[Io]], [[Europa,Moon]], [[Ganymede]], and [[Callisto]]. 
> Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. 
> Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.
>
> Since 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: 
> seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with one more en route and one awaiting launch.
