## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Venus** is the second planet from the Sun. 
> It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size to its orbital neighbour [[../_Standards/Earth|Earth]]. 
> Venus is notable for having the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, 
> composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. 
> 
> At the surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) 
> and a pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. 
> These extreme conditions compress carbon dioxide into a supercritical state 
> close to Venus's surface.
>
> Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Venus lacks an internal dynamo, 
> and its weak induced magnetosphere 
> is caused by atmospheric interactions with the solar wind. 
> Internal heat escapes through active volcanism, 
> resulting in resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. 
> 
> Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System, the other being Mercury, that have no moons. 
> Conditions perhaps favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers. 
> Venus may have had liquid surface water early in its history with a habitable environment, 
> before a runaway greenhouse effect evaporated any water 
> and turned Venus into its present state.
>
> The rotation of Venus has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction (retrograde) 
> by the currents and drag of its atmosphere. 
> It takes 224.7 Earth days for Venus to complete an orbit around the Sun, 
> and a Venusian solar year is just under two Venusian days long. 
> 
> The orbits of Venus and Earth are the closest between any two Solar System planets, 
> approaching each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. 
> Venus and Earth have the lowest difference in gravitational potential 
> of any pair of Solar System planets. 
> This allows Venus to be the most accessible destination 
> and a useful gravity assist waypoint for interplanetary flights from Earth.
>
> Historically, Venus has been a common and important object for humans, 
> in both their cultures and astronomy. 
> 
> Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it always appears close to the Sun in Earth's sky, 
> as either a "morning star" or an "evening star". 
> While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears more prominent, 
> since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun. 
> 
> In 1961, Venus became the target of the first interplanetary flight, Venera 1, 
> followed by many essential interplanetary firsts, 
> such as the first soft landing on another planet by Venera 7 in 1970. 
> These probes demonstrated the extreme surface conditions, 
> an insight that has informed predictions about global warming on Earth. 
> 
> This finding ended the theories and then popular science fiction 
> about Venus being a habitable or inhabited planet.
