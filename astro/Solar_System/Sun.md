> The **Sun** is the star at the center of the [[Solar_System]]. 
> 
> It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated 
> by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. 
> Part of this energy is emitted from its surface as visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, 
> providing most of the energy for life on Earth. 
> 
> The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. 
> It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity.
>
> The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. 
> From Earth, it is 1 AU (1.496×108 km) or about 8 light-minutes away. 
> Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi; 4.64 LS), 109 times that of Earth. 
> Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, 
> making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. 
> 
> Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); 
> the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, 
> including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
>
> The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), 
> informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is actually white. 
> It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago 
> from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. 
> 
> Most of this matter gathered in the center, 
> whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. 
> The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. 
> It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.
>
> Every second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium 
> and converts 4 billion kg of matter into energy. 
> Far in the future, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes 
> to the point where the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, 
> its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature 
> which will cause its outer layers to expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This process will make the Sun large enough 
> to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years from the present. 
> 
> Subsequently, the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star 
> (a white dwarf), and no longer produce energy by fusion, 
> but it will still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion for trillions of years. 
> After that, it is theorized to become a super dense black dwarf, giving off no more energy.
