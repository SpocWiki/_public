# geo Overview
 
The geo Folder primarily defines one (of arbitrarily many possible) Hierarchies for geographical Objects 
where Children are typically topologically contained in their Parents and combined also cover them completely. 

This Hierarchy starts with Continents and Oceans

The RFC2426 vCard Geo Property typically takes a combined "lat,long" as a literal value. 
We recommend the use of new _latitude_ and _longitude_ data properties to capture these values explicitly. 
See Section 4 for an example.
