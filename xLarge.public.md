This is the accompanying Description for the git Repository https://github.com/SpocWiki/xLarge.public, 

which should be checked out into the Sub-Folder of the same Name [[xLarge.public]] to preserve relative Links. 

Detail-Information can found in [[xLarge.public/ReadMe]]. 

Git actually created a [[IT/URL/SymLink|SymLink]] to indicate this Folder. 

 For this to work on iOs you need to use a [[IT/Algorithms/Versioning/Git|Git]]-Client like [[IT/SoftWare/WorkingCopy|WorkingCopy]] and check out into a Subfolder. 
 On Android choose an alternative Git-Client.
