[ #is_/part_of :: https://bib.schema.org ]

Individual comic issues are serially published as
        part of a larger series. For the sake of consistency, even one-shot issues
        belong to a series comprised of a single issue. All comic issues can be
        uniquely identified by: the combination of the name and volume number of the
        series to which the issue belongs; the issue number; and the variant
        description of the issue (if any).
