Use it like this: 
- [ #has/_game_item :: Thing ] or 
- [ has_game_item :: Thing ] 

An item is an object within the game world that can be collected by a player or, occasionally, a non-player character.

Relation describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: Game, VideoGameSeries ]
( #has_/name :: is_game_item )
( #has_/range :: Thing )
