Use it like this: 
- [ #has/_blog_posts :: BlogPosting ] or 
- [ has_blog_posts :: BlogPosting ] 

Indicates a post that is part of a &lt;a class&#x3D;&quot;localLink&quot; href&#x3D;&quot;/Blog&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;. Note that historically, what we term a &quot;Blog&quot; was once known as a &quot;weblog&quot;, and that what we term a &quot;BlogPosting&quot; is now often colloquially referred to as a &quot;blog&quot;.

Relation describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: Blog ]
( #has_/name :: is_blog_posts )
( #has_/range :: BlogPosting )
