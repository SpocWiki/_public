Use it like this: 
- [ #has/_blog_posts :: BlogPosting ] or 
- [ has_blog_posts :: BlogPosting ] 

Indicates a post that is part of a &lt;a class="localLink" href="/Blog"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;. Note that historically, what we term a "Blog" was once known as a "weblog", and that what we term a "BlogPosting" is now often colloquially referred to as a "blog".

Relation describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: Blog ]
( #has_/name :: is_blog_posts )
( #has_/range :: BlogPosting )
