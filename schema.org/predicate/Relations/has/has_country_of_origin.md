[ #is_/part_of :: ]

Use it like this: 
- [ #has/_country_of_origin :: Country] or 
- [ has_country_of_origin :: Country] 

The country of origin of something, including products as well as creative  works such as movie and TV content.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

In the case of TV and movie, this would be the country of the principle offices of the production company or individual responsible for the movie. For other kinds of &lt;a class&#x3D;&quot;localLink&quot; href&#x3D;&quot;/CreativeWork&quot;&gt;CreativeWork&lt;/a&gt; it is difficult to provide fully general guidance, and properties such as &lt;a class&#x3D;&quot;localLink&quot; href&#x3D;&quot;/contentLocation&quot;&gt;contentLocation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class&#x3D;&quot;localLink&quot; href&#x3D;&quot;/locationCreated&quot;&gt;locationCreated&lt;/a&gt; may be more applicable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

In the case of products, the country of origin of the product. The exact interpretation of this may vary by context and product type, and cannot be fully enumerated here.
