[ #is_/part_of :: pending:]

Use it like this: 
- [ #has/_legislation_changes :: Legislation] or 
- [ has_legislation_changes :: Legislation] 

Another legislation that this legislation changes. This encompasses the notions of amendment, replacement, correction, repeal, or other types of change. This may be a direct change (textual or non-textual amendment) or a consequential or indirect change. The property is to be used to express the existence of a change relationship between two acts rather than the existence of a consolidated version of the text that shows the result of the change. For consolidation relationships, use the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;/legislationConsolidates&quot;&gt;legislationConsolidates&lt;/a&gt; property.
