Use it like this: 
- [ #has/_author :: Organization, Person ] or 
- [ has_author :: Organization, Person ] 

The author of this content or rating. Please note that author is special in that HTML 5 provides a special mechanism for indicating authorship via the rel tag. That is equivalent to this and may be used interchangeably.

Relation describes that: 
[ #has_/domain  :: CreativeWork, Rating ]
( #has_/name :: is_author )
( #has_/range :: Organization, Person )
