# Flags Overview
 
Flags are Boolean Predicates with `true` and `false` as the only allowed Values. 

Similar to Tags, they can be attached to Entities,
but there is also a negative Value which can be attached. 

Tags have only an implicit binary Logic where a missing Tag indicates `false`.

Flags implement an explicit binary Logic.
But they can also implement a ternary logic using the empty '` `' Value or be omitted completely.
