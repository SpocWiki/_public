GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.<br/><br/>

The GS1 <a href=""https://www.gs1.org/standards/Digital-Link/"">digital link specifications</a> express GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Details including regular expression examples can be found in, Section 6 of the GS1 URI Syntax specification; see also <a href=""https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/3156#issuecomment-1209522809"">schema.org tracking issue</a> for schema.org-specific discussion. A correct <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin"">gtin</a> value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a ""GS1 Digital Link"" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a <a href=""https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator"">valid GS1 check digit</a> and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also <a href=""http://www.gs1.org/barcodes/technical/idkeys/gtin"">GS1's GTIN Summary</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Trade_Item_Number"">Wikipedia</a> for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin"">gtin</a> property generalizes the earlier <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin8"">gtin8</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin12"">gtin12</a>, <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin13"">gtin13</a>, and <a class=""localLink"" href=""/gtin14"">gtin14</a> properties.<br/><br/>

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details."
