> A spatial reference system (SRS) or coordinate reference system (CRS) is a framework used to precisely measure locations on the surface of the Earth as coordinates. It is thus the application of the abstract mathematics of coordinate systems and analytic geometry to geographic space. 
> 
> A particular SRS specification (for example, "Universal Transverse Mercator WGS 84 Zone 16N") comprises 
> - a choice of Earth ellipsoid, 
> - horizontal datum, 
> - map projection (except in the geographic coordinate system), 
> - origin point, and 
> - unit of measure
>  
> Thousands of coordinate systems have been specified for use around the world or in specific regions and for various purposes, necessitating transformations between different SRS.

> Although they date to the Hellenic Period, spatial reference systems are now a crucial basis for the sciences and technologies of Geoinformatics, including cartography, geographic information systems, surveying, remote sensing, and civil engineering. 
> This has led to their standardization in international specifications such as the [[EPSG]] codes and ISO 19111:2007 Geographic informationâ€”Spatial referencing by coordinates, prepared by ISO/TC 211, also published by the Open Geospatial Consortium as Abstract Specification, Topic 2: Spatial referencing by coordinate.
